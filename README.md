## Marionette: A Hand-Tracked Web Game

CS559 Final Project | Group 1314

### Motivation

As Computer Science students, we spend countless hours typing at keyboards, which puts significant strain on our hands and fingers. Marionette is designed to relax and stretch your fingers through gameplay. By requiring players to alternate between stretching their hands open and clenching them into fists to control the character, the game acts as a fun, interactive "Finger Yoga" session.

### Game Description

Marionette is a 3D browser game inspired by the classic game show "Hole in the Wall." You play as a puppeteer controlling a virtual character using only your hand.

The Mechanic: Using your webcam and Computer Vision (MediaPipe), the game tracks your finger positions in real-time.

The Goal: Walls with specific cut-out shapes fly towards your character. You must change the pose with your hand to make the puppet fit through the hole.

### Two Modes:

Prototype Mode: A clean, geometric visualization using simple primitives.

Full Mode: A polished "Robot" theme with glowing environments, physics-based debris, and explosions upon collision.
